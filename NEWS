Snakeoil Release Notes
======================


* intern gname and uname for TarInfo objects via property trickery- again,
  purpose being less memory usage.

* AtomicFile now marks itself as initially finalized until it has a fd; this
  removes spurios complaints from __del__

* LimitedChangeSet got an additional kwarg; key_validator.  A function can
  be passed in via this to do validation of the desired key- either it throws
  an exception, or returns the key to use.


snakeoil 0.2:

* snakeoil.fileutils.iter_read_bash and friends grew an allow_inline_comment
  param to control stripping of inlined comments; defaults to True.

* bash parsing bug where "x=y" w/out a trailing newline wasn't returning the
  'y' value.

* x=-* (specifically unquoted) is a valid assignment, fixed.

* added SNAKEOIL_DEMANDLOAD_PROTECTION environment variable- if set to
  something other then 'yes', disables the placeholder checks.
  Main intention for this functionality is for when code is introspecting
  demandload consuming code (epydoc for example), and inadvertantly triggers
  the access multiple times.


snakeoil 0.1:

* Add a cpython version of snakeoil.formatters.


snakeoil 0.1 rc2:

* Pulled in any/all cpy extensions if not available in current python version.

* Added several pylint checks for naughty things like bool(len(seq)), itering
  over dict.keys() and shadowing builtins.

* Misc doc improvements.

* Rewrite demandload with a new multiple arg style, and update the appropriate
  pylint checker.

* Fix title updating by flushing the formatter's stream.

* overhaul demandload test case for consuming code.

* Add snakeoil.containers.SetMixin to provide set methods for various
  objects.

* Remove snakeoil.const - unused.

* Improve test coverage in general.

* Add folding dicts.

* Move snakeoil.file to snakeoil.fileutils.

* Initial release, split out from pkgcore.util.*.
