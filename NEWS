Snakeoil Release Notes
======================


* bash parsing bug where "x=y" w/out a trailing newline wasn't returning the
  'y' value.

* x=-* (specifically unquoted) is a valid assignment, fixed.

* added SNAKEOIL_DEMANDLOAD_PROTECTION environment variable- if set to
  something other then 'yes', disables the placeholder checks.
  Main intention for this functionality is for when code is introspecting
  demandload consuming code (epydoc for example), and inadvertantly triggers
  the access multiple times.


snakeoil 0.1:

* Add a cpython version of snakeoil.formatters.


snakeoil 0.1 rc2:

* Pulled in any/all cpy extensions if not available in current python version.

* Added several pylint checks for naughty things like bool(len(seq)), itering
  over dict.keys() and shadowing builtins.

* Misc doc improvements.

* Rewrite demandload with a new multiple arg style, and update the appropriate
  pylint checker.

* Fix title updating by flushing the formatter's stream.

* overhaul demandload test case for consuming code.

* Add snakeoil.containers.SetMixin to provide set methods for various
  objects.

* Remove snakeoil.const - unused.

* Improve test coverage in general.

* Add folding dicts.

* Move snakeoil.file to snakeoil.fileutils.

* Initial release, split out from pkgcore.util.*.
